Explore the TWEETS APP!

I've created this compact application as part of a technical test during my
learning journey.

Built with React and Redux Toolkit, and styled using module.css, this app
comprises two pages: Home and Tweets.

Within the app, you have the ability to follow users, and your followings
persist even if you reload the page.

Additionally, you can filter users based on categories such as all, follow, and
followings.

Best regards, Pavlo Lysianyi.
